## Web Server Manager (Work in Progress)
# Project Overview

Welcome to the Web Server Manager project, an ongoing effort to create a user-friendly tool for managing hosted websites, assigning ports, and implementing a reverse proxy with Nginx. This project is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Note: This project is still in development, and the README will be updated as new features are added.
